# Compare The Transcripts
Some super basic, janky scripts for comparing transcripts generated by different systems. Scripts utilize the Jiwer module and test for the following:
* Word Error Rate
* Match Error Rate
* Word Information Loss
* Word Information Preserved
## Origin
The Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies has over 4,500 testimonies in 20 languages. The Archive has been working through the corpus using AI speech-to-text tools and vendors, like Sonix, Trint, and Whisper (both WhisperX through Aviary and aTrain). Only about a quarter of the collection has been transcribed fully. We decided to do some system testing so we could decide which system to consider to finish transcribing the rest.
## The Stuff in this Repo:
**TranscriptComparisonSingle.py** This compares a single reference transcript and a single test transcript. Outputs a CSV with the comparison data.

**TranscriptComparisonBulk2.py** This runs over a batch of reference and single transcripts. It requires an input CSV with the file path information and outputs a CSV with the comparison data.
